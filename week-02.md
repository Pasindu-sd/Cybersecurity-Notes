# Week 02 - Linux & Networking Basics

## 📚 What I Learned

### 🐧 Linux Basics:
- What is Linux? An open-source operating system.
- File System Structure:
  - `/home` - user files
  - `/etc` - configuration files
  - `/bin` - basic command binaries

### 🌐 Networking Basics:
- What is IP Address?

  - Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices.
- Common Ports:
  - 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 21 (FTP)
