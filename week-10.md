# üõ°Ô∏è Week 10 - Dark Web & OSINT
### Summary
This week focused on studying the Dark Web, the Tor (Onion) network, and Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques. Hands-on practice included using the Tor Browser, OSINT tools like Maltego, and TryHackMe's "Dark Web" room to explore real-world scenarios in a controlled, ethical environment.

### Objectives
 - Understand the fundamentals, risks, and use-cases of Tor and Onion services.
 - Learn safe practices for using the Tor Browser.
 - Learn OSINT methodology and how to gather and analyze publicly available information.
 - Practice investigating Dark Web scenarios and mapping relationships using OSINT tools.

---

### Tools Used
 - Tor Browser ‚Äî Browsing .onion services through the Tor network.
 - Maltego ‚Äî Link analysis and visualization for OSINT investigations.
 - TryHackMe ‚Äì Dark Web Room ‚Äî Practical labs and challenges.
 - Additional utilities: WHOIS/DNS tools, breach checkers (e.g., Have I Been Pwned), paste sites, metadata extractors.

### Procedures & Activities

1. Tor Browser:
   - Studied the architecture of the Tor network and the role of Onion services.
   - Configured the Tor Browser and reviewed privacy-related settings (NoScript, bridge usage, HTTPS-only).

3. Dark Web Overview
   - Learned differences between the public web and .onion domains.
   - Discussed common Dark Web content types: marketplaces, forums, leak sites, and their risks.

4. OSINT Exercises
   - Performed basic footprinting: WHOIS lookup, DNS history, domain metadata, and registry checks.
   - Used Maltego to build entity graphs, map connections, and identify useful leads.
   - Checked emails and usernames against breach databases (Have I Been Pwned).

5. TryHackMe Lab
   - Completed the Dark Web room challenges to apply concepts in realistic scenarios and document findings.

### Key Takeaways
Tor Browser is not a VPN ‚Äî its protections and threats differ; follow Tor-specific best practices.
Only gather and use publicly available information with respect for legal and ethical boundaries.
The Dark Web can host malicious content; avoid visiting suspicious links directly and never download unknown files.
Maltego and similar tools greatly accelerate link discovery and visual analysis during OSINT investigations.
