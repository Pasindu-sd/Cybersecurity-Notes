### Key Takeaways
Tor Browser is not a VPN ‚Äî its protections and threats differ; follow Tor-specific best practices.
Only gather and use publicly available information with respect for legal and ethical boundaries.
The Dark Web can host malicious content; avoid visiting suspicious links directly and never download unknown files.
Maltego and similar tools greatly accelerate link discovery and visual analysis during OSINT investigations.
