## üìÖ Week 1 - Introduction to Cybersecurity

- What is Cybersecurity? ‚û§ The field focused on protecting systems, networks, and data.
- Cybersecurity has 3 major areas: Blue Team, Red Team, and GRC (Governance, Risk & Compliance).
- TryHackMe: Complete the "Introduction to Cybersecurity" Room.
- Install Kali Linux on VirtualBox and practice basic terminal commands:
  - `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`

---

## üìÖ Week 2 - Linux & Networking Basics

- Learn how to navigate the Linux command line.
- Important commands to practice:
  - `chmod`, `rm`, `nano`, `touch`
- Understand File Permissions:
  - Read (`r`), Write (`w`), Execute (`x`)
- Basic Networking Concepts:
  - IP address, MAC address, DNS, and Gateway
- TryHackMe: Complete "Linux Fundamentals Part 1"

---

## üìÖ Week 3 - Nmap , Wiershark & Metasploit Framework

- Learned basic networking concepts: IP address, Ports, Protocols, and Subnets.
- Understood how Nmap is used for network scanning:
  - Performed host discovery and port scanning using `-sS`, `-sV`, `-A`, `-O`.
  - Explored Nmap scripting engine for vulnerability scanning.
- Used Wireshark to analyze HTTP traffic and packet-level data.
- TryHackMe Rooms:
  - Completed "Network Fundamentals"
  - Completed "Nmap"
- Introduced to the Metasploit Framework and its components.
- Learned how to search for exploits and configure payloads and listeners.
- Practiced using `msfconsole` for launching exploits.
- TryHackMe: Completed the "Metasploit" room.
- Set up a vulnerable environment using DVWA for hands-on practice.
