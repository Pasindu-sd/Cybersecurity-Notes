### Types of teams:
1. Red Team(Ethical Hacker, Pentester)
2. Blue Team(Security Analyst, Security Engineer)
3. Purple Team

## Red Team

### What is a red team?
   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines a red team as “a group of people authorized and organized to emulate a potential adversary’s attack or exploitation capabilities against an enterprise’s security posture [1].” The red team plays the part      of the attacker or competitor with the intention of identifying vulnerabilities in a system. 
### Skills:
   - Software development
   - Penetration testing
   - Social engineering
   - Threat intelligence and reverse engineering
   - Creativity

### Certifications:
   - Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)
   - Licensed Penetration Tester (LPT) Master
   - CompTIA PenTest+
   - GIAC Penetration Tester (GPEN)
   - GIAC Exploit Researcher and Advanced Penetration Tester (GXPN)
   - OffSec Certified Professional (OSCP+ and OSCP) certification
   - Certified Red Team Operations Professional (CRTOP)

## Blue Team

### What is a blue team?
   NIST defines a blue team as “the group responsible for defending an enterprise’s use of information systems by maintaining its security posture against a group of mock attackers [6].” If the red team is playing offense, the blue team is playing defense to protect an        organization’s critical assets.
### Skills:
   - Risk assessment
   - Threat intelligence
   - Hardening techniques
   - Monitoring and detection systems

### Certifications:
   - Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)
   - Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA)
   - CompTIA Security+
   - GIAC Security Essentials (GSEC)
   - GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH)
   - Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP)
   - CompTIA SecurityX

# MITRE ATT&CK
The MITRE ATT&CK framework (MITRE ATT&CK) is a universally accessible, continuously updated knowledge base for modeling, detecting, preventing, and fighting cybersecurity threats based on cybercriminals’ known adversarial behaviors.

## MITRE ATT&CK matrices
   - [Enterprise Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/)
   - [Mobile Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/mobile/)
   - [ICS Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/ics/)

### Key components of the MITRE ATT&CK framework
   - Tactics:       represent the overarching goals or objectives of an adversary, such as execution, persistence, or lateral movement. Tactics describe why an attacker performs a certain action.
   - Techniques:    detail how an attacker achieves a specific tactic. For example, credential dumping is a technique used to access account credentials.
   - Procedures:    refer to the real-world implementations of techniques and sub-techniques as observed in actual cyber incidents. For example, these often include named malware families or custom scripts used by threat actors.
