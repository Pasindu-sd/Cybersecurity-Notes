# Bug Bounty

What is Bug Bounty?
A Bug Bounty is a program where companies pay ethical hackers to find and report security vulnerabilities in their websites, apps, APIs, or systems.


You legally test their systems (within their allowed scope) and if you find a bug, they reward you with:

   - Money
   - Hall of Fame recognition
   - Swag / gifts
   - Reputation points
