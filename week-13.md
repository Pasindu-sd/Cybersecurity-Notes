# Bug Bounty

What is Bug Bounty?
A Bug Bounty is a program where companies pay ethical hackers to find and report security vulnerabilities in their websites, apps, APIs, or systems.


You legally test their systems (within their allowed scope) and if you find a bug, they reward you with:

   - Money
   - Hall of Fame recognition
   - Swag / gifts
   - Reputation points

### What Bug Bounty Hunters Do

   - Find weaknesses in websites, mobile apps, APIs, servers.
   - Test for vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, IDOR, CSRF, etc.
   - Create a Proof of Concept (PoC) showing how the bug works.
   - Report it responsibly to the company.
   - Get rewarded if the bug is valid.
