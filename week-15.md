## GDPR Basic Concepts (focused on data privacy)
  - [GDPR.EU Website](https://gdpr.eu/)

**1. Data Privacy**
  - Protecting personal information and ensuring it is used safely and lawfully.

**2. Personal Data**

  - People have rights over their data, such as:
      - Access their data
      - Correct it
      - Delete it (“right to be forgotten”)
      - Limit use
      - Move it to another service (data portability)

**6. Data Controller & Processor**
  - Controller: Decides why and how data is used
  - Processor: Processes data on behalf of the controller

**7. Data Breach**
  - When data is leaked, stolen, or accessed without permission.
    Must be reported quickly (within 72 hours).

## Information Security Principles (Practical Examples) ISO 27001 Basics
  - **1. Access Control**
    - Limit data access only to authorized personnel.
    - Example: Developers should not have full database admin rights.
    - Principles: Least Privilege, Need-to-Know.

  - **2. Encryption**
  Protect data in transit and at rest.
    - *Example:*
      - Use HTTPS/TLS for websites.
      - Store passwords using bcrypt hashing.
      - Encrypt backups with AES/GPG.

  - **3. Data Minimization**
  Collect only the data you actually need.
    - *Example:* Asking for only email + name for a signup form.
    - Avoid unnecessary data like NIC, home address, etc.

  - **4. Logging & Monitoring**
  Keep secure logs to detect suspicious activity.
    - *Example:* Failed login logs, access logs, audit trails.

  - **5. Incident Response**
  Have a plan to handle security breaches quickly.
    - *Example:* Isolate compromised servers, notify affected users.

  - **6. Authentication Policies**
  Ensure strong user authentication.
    - *Example:*
      - Minimum 12-character passwords
      - MFA (TOTP/SMS) enabled
      - Passwords stored with salts

  - **7. Data Retention & Disposal**
  Keep data only for the required time frame.
    - *Example:* CCTV footage kept for 30 days; old backups securely deleted.

  - **8. Physical Security**
  Protect physical access to critical systems.
    - *Example:* Server rooms with access cards, CCTV, locked cabinets.

  - **9. Vendor/Third-Party Security**
  Verify external services meet security standards.
    - *Example:* Cloud provider or payment gateway with ISO 27001/PCI-DSS compliance.

  - **10. Transparency**
  Tell users clearly how their data is used.
    - *Example:* A clear Privacy Policy and a way to request data deletion.
