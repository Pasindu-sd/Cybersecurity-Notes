# 🛡️ Week 08 - NSE, Wireshark, MITM Attacks

## 📚 Overview:
This week focuses on Advanced Nmap Features (NSE), Deep Traffic Analysis with Wireshark, and Basic MITM Attacks

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives:
- Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) Usage
- Wireshark: Deep Traffic Analysis
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Networks
- TryHackMe "Network Security" Room Challenges
- Practical Exercise: Network Testing and Analysis

## 📌 Key Achievements:

- **Automated Scanning:** Mastered the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) to automate vulnerability detection and information gathering.
- **Protocol Deep Dive:** Developed the ability to perform deep packet inspection using Wireshark to detect anomalies and malicious traffic patterns.
- **Attack Simulation:** Understood and simulated Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks (e.g., ARP spoofing) to grasp network interception techniques.
- **Hands-on Experience:** Successfully completed the TryHackMe Network Security module, applying theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.
- **Self-Assessment:** Conducted a practical exercise to test the security posture of a private network.
