### Windows Event Logs Analysis
Critical Event IDs to Monitor:
- 4624 - Successful logon
- 4625 - Failed logon
- 4648 - Logon with explicit credentials
- 4720 - User account created
- 4732 - Member added to security group
- 7045 - New service installed
- 4688 - New process created

Security Use Cases:
- Brute force attack detection
- Account lockout analysis
- Privilege escalation monitoring

---

### Linux Logs Analysis(Syslog, Auth.log) 
Critical Log Files & Analysis:
- ```/var/log/auth.log``` - Authentication & SSH events
- ```/var/log/syslog``` - System-wide events
- ```/var/log/secure``` - Security-related events (RHEL/CentOS)

Key Security Monitoring:
- SSH brute force attacks detection
- Failed login attempts analysis
- sudo command monitoring

Essential Linux Commands:
```
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log                # SSH failure analysis

grep "Accepted" /var/log/auth.log                       # Successful logins

grep "sudo" /var/log/auth.log                           # sudo privilege escalation
```
